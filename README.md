# Simple Currency Converter

In this project, I wrote a program that converts a provided currency to another. To start things off, I print a message to greet your users, followed by the currencies that are available for conversion. Before beginning the program, I asked the user if they wanted to continue using the program or exit. If the user wants to continue using the program, then they're asked to provide the currency they would like to convert and the currency they are converting to. Lastly, the user was asked for the amount specified. 
 
Example:
 
* Welcome to Currency Converter!
* 1 USD equals  1 USD
* 1 USD equals  113.5 JPY
* 1 USD equals  0.89 EUR
* 1 USD equals  74.36 RUB
* 1 USD equals  0.75 GBP
* What do you want to do?
* 1-Convert currencies 2-Exit program
* \> 1
* What do you want to convert?
* From:  USD
* To: \> JPY
* Amount: \> 115
* Result: 115 USD equals 13052.5000 JPY
* What do you want to do?
* 1-Convert currencies 2-Exit program
